   MEDREMINDER - HOW TO TEST YOUR APP
===============================================

You said you don't have a green run button. No problem!
Here's the SIMPLEST way to test your app:

===============================================
METHOD 1: USE YOUR ANDROID PHONE (5 minutes)
===============================================

Do you have an Android phone? This is BY FAR the easiest way!

STEP 1: Enable USB Debugging on Your Phone
-------------------------------------------
On your phone:
  Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
  Go back → Settings → Developer Options → Enable "USB Debugging"

STEP 2: Connect Phone to Computer
----------------------------------
  Plug in USB cable
  On phone: Tap "Allow" when asked about USB debugging

STEP 3: Run the App
-------------------
  Double-click this file: test-app.bat

  That's it! The app will install and launch automatically!

===============================================
METHOD 2: INSTALL APK FILE DIRECTLY
===============================================

Your app is already compiled! Just copy it to your phone:

  1. Copy this file to your phone:
     D:\Git\Teckon\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

  2. On your phone, tap the APK file

  3. Tap "Install"

  Done! Open the MedReminder app from your app drawer.

===============================================
METHOD 3: USE COMMANDS (if you prefer)
===============================================

In PowerShell, run these commands one at a time:

1. Check if device is connected:

   C:\Users\mrich\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe devices

2. Install app:

   cd D:\Git\Teckon
   .\gradlew.bat installDebug

3. Launch app:

   C:\Users\mrich\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe shell am start -n com.example.medreminder/.ui.MainActivity

===============================================
DON'T HAVE A PHONE? CREATE AN EMULATOR
===============================================

If you have Android Studio installed:

1. Look for "Device Manager" icon (phone/tablet icon)
   - Check the right sidebar
   - Or top toolbar
   - Or menu: View → Tool Windows → Device Manager

2. Click "Create Device" button

3. Choose "Pixel 4" and click Next

4. Download "API 33" system image and click Next

5. Click Finish

6. Click the Play (▶) button to start emulator

7. Run: test-app.bat

===============================================
